## Type Categories

### Basic Types
- `int` (and variants: int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, etc.)
- `float` (float32, float64)
- `bool`
- `string`
- `byte` (alias for uint8)
- `rune` (alias for int32, represents Unicode code points)
- `complex` (complex64, complex128)

### Composite Types
- `array` (fixed-size collection of elements)
- `slice` (dynamic-size sequence of elements)
- `map` (key-value pairs)
- `struct` (custom data type with named fields)
- `pointer` (reference to memory address)
- `function` (first-class functions)
- `channel` (communication between goroutines)

### Other Topics
- `interface` (type definitions based on behavior)
- `conversion` (converting between types)
